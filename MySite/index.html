<section id="about">
<p>My name is <em><strong>JoLynn Marie Williams</strong></em>. I am 21 years old. I was born and raised in Chelan, Washington. I have 2 sisters who are 19 and 15 years old. I am currently living in Lynnwood, Washington. Which is a suburb of Seattle. Before I moved to Lynnwood, I was living in Waikiki Hawaii. I love to travel. And hope to one day visit all 50 states and backpack through Europe.</p>

<p>Music is something that I can't live without. I have based a lot of my life through lyrics. Watching a band live in concert puts a huge smile on my face. I listen to all kinds of genres; from country music to hardcore metal. The first concert I ever went to was Garth Brooks. I have met a couple of my favorite bands and have their autographs during <a href="http://www.vanswarpedtour.com">Warped Tour</a>.</p>
