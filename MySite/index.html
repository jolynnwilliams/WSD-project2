<section id="about">
<p>My name is <em><strong>JoLynn Marie Williams</strong></em>. I am 21 years old. I am from Chelan, Washington. I have 2 sisters who are 19 and 15 years old. I am currently living in Lynnwood, Washington. Which is a suburb of Seattle. Before I moved to Lynnwood, I was living in Waikiki, Hawaii. I love to travel and try to visit my friends from all over as much as possible. And hope to one day backpack through Europe. I'm a very outgoing and spontaneous person. I love to make people laugh. I played three sports in high school; volleyball, basketball and softball. My friends and I love to take road trips to random place as much as we can.</p>

<p>Music is something that I can't live without. I have based a lot of my life through lyrics. Watching a band live in concert puts a huge smile on my face. I listen to all kinds of genres; from country music to hardcore metal. The first concert I ever went to was Garth Brooks. I have met a couple of my favorite bands and have their autographs during <a href="http://www.vanswarpedtour.com">Warped Tour</a>.</p>

<p>I graduated Chelan High School in June of 2008. I did not start college unitl January of 2009, where I attended Skagit Valley College. At first I was focusing on earning my ATA degree in Mulitmedia and Interactive Technology until I learned that I had already had enough credits to graduate with my Certificte of Web Assistant, which I earned in 2010. After that I kept going with my ATA degree which I had later earned in 2011. I am not at Full Sail University working on my Bachelor of Science degree which has always been my dream to earn.</p>
